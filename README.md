2. Run the Server
Start the Server:

In your terminal, while inside your project directory, run:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Check the Output:

You should see output indicating that the server is running, such as:

arduino
Copy code
Server running at http://localhost:3000/

3. Access the Server in Your Browser
Open your web browser and navigate to:
